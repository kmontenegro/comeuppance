                <p>We believe that technology is nothing but a lever. Technology is not justice, technology is not equity, technology will not save us. Technology can help us do our work in a more secure, inclusive, and hopefully egalitarian way.</p>
<p>Our vision is to be a support and resource to organizations and individuals who hope to leverage technology in the way envisioned above.</p>
<p>Currently, as a consulting practice of one, we must take a boutique approach to clients and, if we aren't a right fit, we'd be glad to recommend someone we know.</p>
<p>Contact us if you'd like to explore a new and holistic approach to technology, data stewardship, and digital security.</p>

He is also a co-founder of the <a href="https://www.stoplapdspying.org">Stop LAPD Spying Coalition</a>.</p>
<p>Current services are focused on delivering limited facilitation, training, strategy, and planning services to nonprofits. Due to capacity, we must limit our engagements.</p>

<p>No PGP/GPG?!? Yes, without training, support, and care, it's easy for folks to mess up using key-based encrypted email. I'm a strong supporter of end-to-end encrypted email provider Tutanota as it provides practical security, much as Signal does for SMS/text messaging.</p>
